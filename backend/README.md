XP Core Values
Throughout all the sprinrs we followed below stated XP core values:

Respect

Throughout the project, all the team members were respectful of each other’s time, availability and the deliverables deadline.
The team was respectful of each other's suggestion in choosing the tools and technologies. Based on the individual's skills and comfort level, the team was accommodative to agree upon the framework utilized and programming languages. Nevertheless, all the team members were enthusiastic to learn and incorporate new software skills.

Communication

Communication was one of the key strengths of our team. We had weekly calls scheduled for every Thurusday morning to discuss the functionality, make necessary design decisions and assumptions.
During the call we made sure to understand the progress, dependency on each other and any blockers.
We maintained Github projects Kanban Board to maintain the list of ToDo, InProgress, Completed tasks. This also helped us to understand the progress of various tasks throughout the sprint.


Simplicity

At every step of our project we always evaluated the primary goals to be accomplished inorder to stay focused on what was required in the MVP.
We always had a segregation of “must haves” and “if possible”.
We tried to reduce complexity while designing the database, api endpoints and the UI as well.

Feedback

Feedback also played a very important role during the project development and testing phase.
During the development phase we always pushed our changes to a branch and created pull requests. Once the code was approved by another team member, we pushed the changes to the master branch. We made sure the code changes on the master branch was always stable and did not break the other team member’s code.
During the testing phase, we gave feedback to each other by testing the features developed by team members. This helped in identifying the bugs.
The constant feedback helped to identify the unknowns and scenarios or features missed during the initial phase of the project. That helped us to make better assumptions and collective decisions.
